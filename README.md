# Bookfolio

Bookfolio is a React native bookcase app designed to help you organize and manage your library. It allows you to keep detailed notes on each book in your collection and provides features for adding or removing books from your virtual bookshelf.

## Key Features

- **Book Tracker:** Utilizes the Google Books API to track and manage your book collection seamlessly.
- **Note-Taking:** Incorporates Firebase NoSQL for efficient and secure storage of user-generated book notes.
